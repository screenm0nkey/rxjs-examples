<h3>share() considered a warm observable as it only publishes on at least one subscription</h3>
<pre>
  Share creates a hot observable. It's a shortcut for .publish().refCount()

  Returns an observable sequence that shares a single subscription to the underlying sequence. This operator is a
  specialization of publish which creates a subscription when the number of observers goes from zero to one, then
  shares that subscription with all subsequent observers until the number of observers returns to zero, at which point
  the subscription is disposed. (see .publish().refCount())

    .do(function (x) {
      log(x, 'pink');
    });

  var published$ = source2$.share();

  // When the number of observers subscribed to published observable goes from
  // 0 to 1, we connect to the underlying observable sequence.
  var autoDetachObserver1 = published$.subscribe(createObserverB('SourceE', 'red'));
  // When the second subscriber is added, no additional subscriptions are added to the
  // underlying observable sequence. As a result the operations that result in side
  // effects are not repeated per subscriber.
