<h3>forkJoin</h3>
<pre>
    If we want to compare forkjoin to promises it would be similar to $q.all() from Angular 1.x

    We use forkJoin to execute observables in parallel. One common use case of
    this is making multiple http requests in parallel. In my sample I am
    forkJoining two very simple observables, but the key point is that the
    <strong>subscriber won't receive any values until both observables have completed</strong>.

<script src="/lib/Rx5.umd.js"></script>
<script>
    let first = Rx.Observable.of({source: 1, value: 1});
    let second = Rx.Observable.of({source: 2, value: 1});

    Rx.Observable.forkJoin(first, second).subscribe(function (res) {
        console.log(JSON.stringify(res))
    });
</script>
