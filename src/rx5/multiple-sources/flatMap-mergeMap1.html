<h3>flatMap</h3>

<h3>flatMap() is called mergeMap() in RxJs5 and is the same as <pre>map().mergeAll()</pre></h3>

<h4>flatmap() is similar to flatMapLatest() (flatMapLatest is called SwitchMap in RXJS 5)  </h4>

<pre>
    the only difference between flatMap() and switchMap() (flatmapLatest) is
    Both operators automatically subscribe to an Observable stream
    and flatten the result for us. The difference is that the switchMap()
    operator automatically unsubscribes from previous subscriptions as soon as the outer
    Observable emits new values. this makes it good for keyup searches on form inputs
    where the previous search can be cancelled.

    Merges an observable sequence of observable sequences into a observable sequence of
    data from the observables. what is does is subscribe the the observables in the
    original observable stream and returns their values.

    it outputs all the values but the output is not in order i.e. it doesn't just output
    everything from the first collection, then the next and so on.

    See <strong>flatMapLatest</strong> example.

    from() converts an array to a rx collection

    // it you replace flatmap for map you will just get objects

            console.log('flatMap '+x);

    // does same as above but with map.mergeAll()
    Rx.Observable

        })
        .do(function(x){
            // at this point x is an observable. mergeAll will subscribe to each observable and return the value
