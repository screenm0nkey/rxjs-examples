<h3>flatMap</h3>
<pre>
    flatMap is how we handle dependencies between observables. My sample is contrived,
    but I am returning a value from the first observable that is needed
    by the second observable to calculate a sum.

    Like I said this example is contrived, but if we compare this to promises,
    flatMap is how we would create the equivalent of promise chains.

    flattens observables and returns their value

    let first = Rx.Observable.of(10);

    first.flatMap(function(operand1) {
        return Rx.Observable.of(operand1 + 10);
    })
    .subscribe(function(res) {
        console.log(JSON.stringify({msg: '10 + 10 = ' + res}))
    });
