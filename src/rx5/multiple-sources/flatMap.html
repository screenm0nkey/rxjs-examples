<h3>flatMap (mergeMap rxjs5)</h3>
<pre>
    flattens observables and returns their value.

    flatMap is how we handle dependencies between observables. My sample is contrived,
    but I am returning a value from the first observable that is needed
    by the second observable to calculate a sum.

    Like I said this example is contrived, but if we compare this to promises,
    flatMap is how we would create the equivalent of promise chains.

    let first = Rx.Observable.of(10);

    first.flatMap(function (operand1) {
        return Rx.Observable.of(operand1 + 10);
    })
            .subscribe(function (res) {
                console.log(JSON.stringify({msg: '10 + 10 = ' + res}))
            });
