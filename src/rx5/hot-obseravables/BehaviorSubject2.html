<h3>BehaviorSubject (hot observable)</h3>

<pre>
    Observers can subscribe to the subject to receive the last (or initial) value
    and all subsequent notifications.

    If you are looking for BehaviorSubject without initial value see <strong>Subject</strong>.
    Also look at ReplaySubject which is the same as BehaviorSubject but has a buffer
    instead of just the last value.

    This also seems to be the same as <strong>Rx.Subject</strong>
    but without the initial value. Have a look at the RX.Subject example
</pre>

<script src="/lib/Rx5.umd.js"></script>
<script>

    // interval() emits an integer every 500ms
    var source$ = Rx.Observable.interval(500);

    // the initial value will be CATTTT
    var behaviorSubject$ = new Rx.BehaviorSubject('CATTTT'); //initial value

    // our behaviorSubject$ is also an observer so we can pass it into the subSource$
    var subSource$ = source$.subscribe(behaviorSubject$);

    // subscribe to the hot stream. it will get CATTTT initially
    behaviorSubject$.subscribe(function (x) {
        console.log('a ' + x);
    });

    // subscribe to the hot stream at a later point it gets the last value from the stream
    setTimeout(function () {
        behaviorSubject$.subscribe(function (x) {
            console.log('\tb ' + x);
        });
    }, 3000);


    setTimeout(function () {
        behaviorSubject$.complete();
        subSource$.complete();
    }, 6000);

</script>
