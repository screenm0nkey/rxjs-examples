<h3>Publish (convert cold observable to hot)</h3>

<pre>
  We can see that there must have been only one call to hot with this setup as the numbers
  are identical. So, is it hot now? Well, kind of. Let’s put it that way: it’s warmer than a cold one but colder than a
  really hot one. It’s hot in the sense that there’s no new value producer/source (the thing calling observer.next(val))
  created upon subscription. But it’s cold in the sense that it doesn’t start producing values before the subscriptions exist.
</pre>

<script src="/lib/Rx5.umd.js"></script>
<script>

  var subscription1, subscription2;

  // Creates "source", a cold observable
  var source$ = Rx.Observable.interval(1000)
    .take(11)
    .do(function (val) {
    // this wont start logging until there is a subscription and that only happens when we call hot$.connect();
    log(val, 'red');
  });

  // Convert the sequence into a hot sequence
  var hot$ = source$.publish();

  // No value is pushed to 1st subscription at until the hot.connect() is called, at which point is subscribes
  subscription1 = hot$.subscribe((x)=> {
    log(x, 'green')
  });


  setTimeout(() => {
    // At this point the first subscription will start getting values starting from 0
    // The original 'source' observable wont start until hot.connect() is called.
    hot$.connect();
  }, 2000);


  setTimeout(() => {
    // observer will start to receive values from 6 onwards
    subscription2 = hot$.subscribe((x)=> {
      log(x, 'blue')
    });
  }, 7000);


  setTimeout(() => {
    hot$
    subscription1.complete();
    subscription2.complete();
  }, 10000);


</script>
