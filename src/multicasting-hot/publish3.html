<h3>.publish().refCount(), .publishLast().refCount()</h3>
<h3>.share() is a shortcut for .publish().refCount()</h3>

    The publish() operator creates an ConnectableObservable which means it creates an Observable
    that shares one single subscription to the underlying source. However, the publish operator
    doesn’t subscribe to the underlying source just yet. It’s more like a gatekeeper that makes
    sure that subscriptions aren’t made to the underlying source but to the ConnectableObservable instead.

    It’s the job of the connect operator to actually cause the ConnectableObservable to subscribe to
    the underlying source (the thing that produces values). In our case we’re using refCount which
    is an operator that builds up on connect and causes the ConnectableObservable to subscribe
    to the underlying source as soon as there is a first subscriber and to unsubscribe from it
    as soon as there’s no subscriber anymore. It simply keeps track of how many subscriptions
    are made to the ConnectableObservable.

    refcount() below stops the clock$ stream from publishing any values until there is at least one observer.
    It will also stop if the observer count goes to 0. so it waits for the first connection before publishing.

<script src="/lib/Rx5.umd.js"></script>
<script>

  var clock$ = Rx.Observable
    .interval(500)
    .take(10)
    .map((x)=> {
      return x + 1;
    })
    .startWith(0)
    .publish()
    .refCount(); // refCount keeps track of how many subscriptions are made to the publish()'s ConnectableObservable.

  //    clock.connect();

  setTimeout(() => {
    log('a subscribed', 'red');
    clock$.subscribe(function (i) { // nothing starts until this subscription.
      log(i, 'red');
    });
  }, 2000);

  setTimeout(() => {
    log('b subscribed', 'blue');
    clock$.subscribe(function (i) {
      log(i, 'blue');
    });
  }, 4500);
