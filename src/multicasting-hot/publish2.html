<h3>Publish (make cold observable hot or rather warm)</h3>

  /*
   The publish operator creates an ConnectableObservable which means it creates an Observable that shares one single
   subscription to the underlying source. However, the publish operator doesn’t subscribe to the underlying source
   just yet. It’s more like a gatekeeper that makes sure that subscriptions aren’t made to the underlying source but
   to the ConnectableObservable instead.

   It’s the job of the connect operator to actually cause the ConnectableObservable to subscribe to the underlying
   source (the thing that produces values).

    .map((x)=> {
      return x + 1;
    })

    .publish();
