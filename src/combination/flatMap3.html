<h2>flatMap (same as map().mergeAll()) (mergeMap in rx5)</h2>
<h3>flatMap is an alias for mergeMap</h3>
<pre>
    flattens observables and returns their value.

    flatMap is how we handle dependencies between observables. the sample is contrived,
    but I am returning a value from the first observable that is needed
    by the second observable to calculate a sum.

    Like I said this example is contrived, but if we compare this to promises,
    flatMap is how we would create the equivalent of promise chains.

  Rx.Observable.of(10).flatMap(operand => Rx.Observable.of(operand + 10))
    .subscribe(res => {
      console.log(JSON.stringify({msg: '10 + 10 = ' + res}))
    });
