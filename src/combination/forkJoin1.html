<h3>forkJoin</h3>

    Combining Multiple RxJs Streams In Angular
</a>
<pre>
    If we want to compare forkjoin to promises it would be similar to $q.all() from Angular 1.x

    We use forkJoin to execute observables in parallel. One common use case of
    this is making multiple http requests in parallel. In my sample I am
    forkJoining two very simple observables, but the key point is that the
    <strong>subscriber won't receive any values until both observables have completed</strong>.
</pre>

<script src="/lib/Rx5.umd.js"></script>
<script>
  let first = Rx.Observable.of({source: 1, value: 1, col: 'red'}).delay(1000);
  let second = Rx.Observable.of({source: 2, value: 1, col: 'green'});

  Rx.Observable.forkJoin(first, second).subscribe(function (res) {
    log(res[0], res[1])
  });
</script>
