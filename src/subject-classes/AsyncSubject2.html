  // Rx.DOM gets the json data and calls .next(data) on it's observers, which in this case it the asyncSubject.
  // asyncSubject is also an observable so it calls .next(data) on it's observers which is the 'observer'.
  // the observer calls .next(data) on it's observers which is 'products.subscribe()...'
  // there is a delay on the Rx.DOM to simulate a slow http

  /*
   In this code, when getProducts is called with a URL, it returns an Observer that emits
   the result of the HTTP GET request. Here’s how it breaks down:
   1 getProducts returns an Observable sequence. We create it here.
   2 If we haven’t created an AsyncSubject yet, we create it and subscribe it to
   the Observable that Rx.DOM.Request.get(url) returns.
   3 We subscribe the Observer to the AsyncSubject. Every time an Observer subscribes to the Observable,
   it will actually be subscribed to the AsyncSubject, which is acting as a proxy between
   the Observable retrieving the URL and the Observers.
   4 We create the Observable that retrieves the URL "products" and store it in the products variable.
   5 This is the first subscription and will kick off the URL retrieval and log the results when the URL is retrieved.
   6 This is the second subscription, which runs five seconds after the first one. Since at that time
   the URL has already been retrieved, there’s no need for another network request.
   It will receive the result of the request immediately because it is already stored in the AsyncSubject subject.
