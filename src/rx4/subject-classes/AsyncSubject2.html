<h3>Subject</h3>

<pre>
    AsyncSubject emits the last value of a sequence only if the sequence completes.
    This value is then cached forever, and any Observer that subscribes after the
    value has been emitted will receive it right away. AsyncSubject is convenient
    for asynchronous operations that return a single value, such as Ajax requests.

    AsyncSubject represents the result of an asynchronous action, and you can use
    it as a substitute for a promise. The difference internally is that a promise
    will only ever process a single value, whereas AsyncSubject processes all values
    in a sequence, only ever emitting (and caching) the last one.

    Being able to so easily simulate promises shows the flexibility of the RxJS model.
    (Even without AsyncSubject, it would be pretty easy to simulate a promise using Observables.)
