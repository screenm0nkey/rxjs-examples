<h3>Observer</h3>

<pre>
    The Observer object provides support for push-style iteration over an observable sequence.

    The Observer and Objects interfaces provide a generalized mechanism
    for push-based notification, also known as the observer design pattern.
    The Observable object represents the object that sends notifications (the provider);
    the Observer object represents the class that receives them (the observer).

<script src="/lib/Rx4.js"></script>

<script>
  // the observable calls the "next()" method of the observer
  let observable$ = Rx.Observable.of(42).map(x => ({val: x, col: 'green'}))

  let observer = Rx.Observer.create(
    (x) => log(x.val, x.col),
    (err) => log(err, 'red'),
    () => log('complete'));

  observer.next({val: 'CAT', col: 'red'});
  observable$.subscribe(observer);
